# Statistical test description


## Testing binary expansion of constans 

In this section we perform frequency monobit test for number $\pi, e, \sqrt{2}$. More formally we will use their binary expansion as the random bit sequence. We use provided files with binary expansions. For inference we will follow instruction from official **NIST** report. 

Some important notes from report about most basic test. 


>2.1.5 Decision Rule (at the $1 \%$ Level)
>
> If the computed $P$-value is $<0.01$, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude that the sequence is random.

>2.1.7 Input Size Recommendation
>
> It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consist of a minimum of 100 bits (i.e., $n \geq 100$).

```{python import-python-modules}
import pickle

byRow = 1
byCol = 0
```


```{python test}
import numpy as np
import math
from scipy.stats import norm


def frequency_monobit_test(bits):
#   bits should be already mapped into [-1,1]
    n = len(bits)
    S = np.sum(bits)
    S_obs = abs(S) / math.sqrt(n)
    p_value = 2 * (1 - norm.cdf(S_obs))
    return p_value
```


```{python read-data-e}
with open('../data/binary_expansion_e.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)

numbers = data["numbers"]
sequence_e = 2 * numbers - 1 # map into -1 , 1 
```


```{python read-data-pi}

with open('../data/binary_expansion_pi.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)

numbers = data["numbers"]
sequence_pi = (2 * numbers - 1) # map into -1 , 1 
```


```{python read-data-sqrt2}

with open('../data/binary_expansion_sqrt2.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)

numbers = data["numbers"]
sequence_sqrt2 = 2 * numbers - 1 # map into -1 , 1 
```

```{python calculate-pval-for-constants}

p_val =	{
  "pi": frequency_monobit_test(sequence_pi),
  "e": frequency_monobit_test(sequence_e),
  "sqrt2": frequency_monobit_test(sequence_sqrt2)
}

length =	{
  "pi": len(sequence_pi),
  "e": len(sequence_e),
  "sqrt2": len(sequence_sqrt2)
}

```



| Constant name  |  $p_{value}$ | Input Size|
|---|---|---|
| $\pi$  |`r py$p_val["pi"]`| `r py$length["pi"]` |
| $e$  |`r py$p_val["e"]`| `r py$length["e"]`|
| $\sqrt{2}$  |`r py$p_val["sqrt2"]`|`r py$length["sqrt2"]` | 

The size of out data is aligned  with **NIST** recommendations. Authors recommend $0.01$ as significance level for PRNG testing. From above table we conclude that binary expansion of each mentioned constants could be considered as random bit sequence. 


## Second level testing for bits

Because the size of sample are quite big we can try another approach. We split the sequence into a lot of smaller samples. We use the smallest recommended $n=100$ for this test. The split method will be very straightforward. We simply take first $100$ bits for first sample, another $100$ for second sample and so on.

```{python split-into-many-samples}

default_sample_size = 100

def trim_to_multiple_of_n (array, n = default_sample_size):
    sample_number = int(len(array) / n)
    return (array[:(sample_number * n)], sample_number)
  
sequence_sqrt2_samples, sample_number = trim_to_multiple_of_n(sequence_sqrt2)
sequence_sqrt2_samples = sequence_sqrt2_samples.reshape((sample_number, default_sample_size))

p_values_sequence_sqrt2_samples = np.apply_along_axis(frequency_monobit_test, byRow, sequence_sqrt2_samples)
```

```{python plots}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(p_values_sequence_sqrt2_samples, bins = "auto")
plt.title("P value distribution for $\sqrt{2}$")
plt.show()
```


We can take a look a histogram of p_values. TODO: the same plot for others.
